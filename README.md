# TypeScript end-to-end add login button to client application 

For a complete tutorial, please use the [Microsoft Documentation tutorial found here](https://aka.ms/js-login-button).

## Create-react-app

The SPA built in this tutorial is a React app (create-react-app) with the following tasks:

- Login using a Microsoft-supported login such as Office 365 or Outlook.com
- Log off the application

To provide a quick and simple single page application, the sample uses **create-react-app** with TypeScript. This front-end framework provides several shortcuts in typical client development with Azure SDKs:

- Bundling, required for Azure SDKs used in a client-application
- Environment variables in the `.env` file
